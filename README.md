# EmployeeX

EmployeeX is a full-stack Employee Management System built with **Spring Boot** (backend), **SQLite** (database), and **React** (frontend).  
It allows you to manage employees, view analytics (gender distribution, department breakdown, average age), and perform full CRUD operations through a clean UI.

## üöÄ Features
- Add, Edit, Delete, and View Employees  
- KPI Dashboard (Total Employees, Average Age, Distinct Departments)  
- Charts: Gender Distribution (Pie) and Department Breakdown (Bar)  
- Form validation and toast notifications for success/errors  
- Lightweight local persistence using SQLite  
- Responsive UI built with React and Recharts

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate  
- **Database:** SQLite (file-based)  
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Recharts, React Toastify  
- **Build tools:** Maven (with `mvnw` wrapper), npm

## üì¶ Installation & Local Setup

### 0. Prerequisites
- Java 17+ installed and `JAVA_HOME` set  
- Maven or use the included Maven wrapper (`./mvnw`)  
- Node.js 18+ and npm (or yarn)

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/employeeX.git
cd employeeX
```

---

### 1. Database (SQLite)
No manual DB installation required. The backend uses SQLite and will create a local file (e.g. `employees.db`) in the backend working directory when the server starts (as long as `spring.datasource.url=jdbc:sqlite:employees.db`).

**Important:** use `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update` (or `create`) in `application.properties` while developing. Avoid `create-drop` if you want data to persist after the server stops.

Sample `application.properties` (backend `src/main/resources/application.properties`):
```properties
spring.application.name=EmployeeX
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:sqlite:employees.db
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.sqlite.JDBC

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

# Optional: if you use a community SQLite dialect (add dependency if required)
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.community.dialect.SQLiteDialect
```

---

### 2. Backend (Spring Boot)

Change to backend folder and run the app.

#### Mac / Linux
```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

#### Windows (PowerShell / CMD)
```powershell
cd backend
mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Server will be available at: `http://localhost:8080`

Build a jar (optional):
```bash
cd backend
./mvnw -DskipTests package
java -jar target/*.jar
```

Run tests:
```bash
./mvnw test
```

---

### 3. Frontend (React)

Open a new terminal and run the frontend.

#### Mac / Linux
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

#### Windows (PowerShell / CMD)
```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Frontend will be available at: `http://localhost:3000`

**Environment variable (optional):** create `.env` in `frontend/` with:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```
Use this variable in your API helper so the frontend points to the correct backend.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common issues & fixes

**Hibernate / Dialect errors**
- `Unable to determine Dialect without JDBC metadata` ‚Üí ensure `spring.datasource.url` is set (e.g. `jdbc:sqlite:employees.db`) and/or set `spring.jpa.database-platform` to a valid dialect.

**Driver missing (MySQL)**
- `Cannot load driver class: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver` ‚Üí remove MySQL settings or add MySQL connector dependency. For SQLite, ensure dependency for SQLite JDBC is in `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.xerial</groupId>
  <artifactId>sqlite-jdbc</artifactId>
  <version>3.41.2.1</version>
</dependency>
```

**Schema mismatch (`no such column: e1_0.age`)**
- After adding a new field (e.g., `age`) to the entity, either:
  - set `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update` so Hibernate updates the schema, or
  - delete the `employees.db` and restart the app if you want a fresh schema (development only).

**Data disappears on restart**
- If `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop` is set, data will be removed on shutdown. Use `update` or `create` for persisting data during development.

**React NavLink active highlight persists**
- Make sure file imports match file system casing exactly (e.g. `Navbar.js` vs `navbar.js`). On some systems this causes duplicates in the module graph and sticky active states. Use consistent file name casing.

---

## üîß Tips & configuration

- **Change API base URL (frontend)**: set `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api` in `frontend/.env`.
- **Logging / SQL**: `spring.jpa.show-sql=true` in `application.properties` helps debugging SQL queries.
- **Persist DB file**: commit `employees.db` only for demo; usually you should add it to `.gitignore`.

## üß™ Tests
If you added backend tests, run:
